// What is web accesibility?
// Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed
// so that people with disabilities can use them.
// More specifically, people can:
// perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web
// contribute to the Web
// Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including:
// auditory
// cognitive
// neurological
// physical
// speech
// visual
// Web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, for example:
// people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc.
// older people with changing abilities due to ageing

// example of web accesibility
// <label for="username">Username:</label>
// <input type="text" id="username" name="username">
//  <label for="password">Password:</label>
// <input type="password" id="password" name="password">

// Here are key practices and tools for improving web accessibility in a React application:
// Use semantic HTML elements: Use semantic HTML elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>,
//<article>, <section>, and <footer> to give meaning to the content.</footer>

//Accessible Forms : Use <label> elements to associate labels with form controls.
// keyboard navigation: Ensure that all interactive elements can be accessed and used with a keyboard.
//  Aria Attributes : Use ARIA attributes to provide additional information to assistive technologies.
// Focus Management : Ensure that focus is managed correctly when navigating through the application.
// Color Contrast : Ensure that text and background colors have sufficient contrast to be readable.
// Screen Reader Testing : Test the application with a screen reader to ensure that it is accessible to users with visual impairments.
